### Notes
**Note 1**: The label `namespace` holds a value `NOT_FOUND_INTERNAL` when the `container_id` and the IP can't be found in the current Kubernetes cluster, in which case the entity isn't maintained by the current Kubernetes.

**Note 2**: The labels `request_content` and `response_content` hold different values when `protocol` is different.

- When protocol is `http`:

| **Label** | **Example** | **Notes** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `request_content` | /test/api | Endpoint of HTTP request. URL has been truncated to avoid high-cardinality. |
| `response_content` | 200 | 'Status Code' of HTTP response. |

- When protocol is `dns`:

| **Label** | **Example** | **Notes** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `request_content` | www.google.com | Domain to be queried |
| `response_content` | 0 | "rcode" of DNS response. Including 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 |

- When protocol is `mysql`:

| **Label** | **Example** | **Notes** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `request_content` | select employee | SQL of MySQL. SQL has been truncated to avoid high-cardinality. The format is ['operation' 'space' 'table' '*']. |
| `response_content` | 1064 | Error code of MySQL. Only applicable when the response is in error type. See [codes introduction](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/5.7/en/error-reference-introduction.html).|

- For other cases, the `request_content` and `response_content` are both empty.

**Note 3**: The histogram metric `kindling_entity_request_average_duration_nanoseconds_*` is disabled by default as it could be high-cardinality. If this metric is needed, please add a new line to the `exporters.otelexporter.metric_aggregation_map` section of the configuration file.
```yaml
exporters:
  otelexporter:
    metric_aggregation_map:
      # add the following line
      kindling_entity_request_average_duration_nanoseconds: histogram 
```

## Topology Metrics

Topology metrics are typically generated from the client-side events, which are used to show the service dependencies map, so the metrics are called "topology". Some timeseries may be generated from the server-side events, which contain a non-empty label `dst_container_id`. These timeseries are generated only when the source IP is not the pod's IP inside the Kubernetes cluster, which are useful when there is no agent installed on the client-side.

### Metrics List
| **Metric Name** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `kindling_topology_request_total` | Counter | Total number of requests |
| `kindling_topology_request_duration_nanoseconds_total` | Counter |  Total duration of requests |
| `kindling_topology_request_request_bytes_total` | Counter | Total size of payload sent |
| `kindling_topology_request_response_bytes_total` | Counter | Total size of payload received |
| `kindling_topology_request_average_duration_nanoseconds_count` | Histogram | Count of average duration of requests<br> **Disabled by default. See Note 3 for how to enable it.** |â€‹
| `kindling_topology_request_average_duration_nanoseconds_sum` | Histogram | Sum of average duration of requests<br> **Disabled by default. See Note 3 for how to enable it.** |
| `kindling_topology_request_average_duration_nanoseconds_bucket` | Histogram | Histogram buckets of average duration of requests<br> **Disabled by default. See Note 3 for how to enable it.** |

| `src_container` | business-container | The name of the source container |
| `src_container_id` | 1a2b3c4d5e6f | The shorten container id which contains 12 characters |
| `src_ip` | 10.1.11.23 | The IP address of the source |
| `dst_node` | slave-node2 | Which node the destination pod is on |
| `dst_namespace` | default | Namespace of the destination pod |

| `dst_port` | 80 | The listening port of the destination container  |
| `protocol` | http | The application layer protocol the requests use |
| `status_code` | 200 | Different values for different protocols  |

### Notes
**Note 1**: We define two custom terms for the label `src_namespace` and `dst_namespace`, which are `NOT_FOUND_INTERNAL` and `NOT_FOUND_EXTERNAL`. The meanings are described as follows. These terms also apply to other metrics in this doc.

These two terms are composed of two parts.
1. **NOT_FOUND**: `NOT_FOUND` means the IP is neither a pod's one nor a service's one in the current Kubernetes cluster. The IP could belong to a host or an external service.
2. **INTERNAL or EXTERNAL**: There are two cases in which `INTERNAL` will be set. The first case is when the IP belongs to a node that resides in the current Kubernetes cluster. The second case is when the `source` or `destination` is running on the same host with the kindling agent, which is generally applicable for non-Kubernetes clusters. `EXTERNAL` is set for other cases if the IP is `NOT_FOUND`. Note another Kubernetes cluster is also considered "external".

**Note 2**: The field "status_code" holds different values when "protocol" is different.

- **http**: `Status Code` of HTTP response.
- **dns**: `rcode` of DNS response.
- **mysql**: `Error Code` of the error response.
- **dubbo**: `Error Code` of Dubbo request.
- **redis**: `0` if there is no error; `1` otherwise.
- **rocketmq**: `Code` of RocketMQ response
- **others**: empty temporarily.

**Note 3**: The histogram metric `kindling_topology_request_average_duration_nanoseconds_*` is disabled by default as it could be high-cardinality. If this metric is needed, please add a new line to the `exporters.otelexporter.metric_aggregation_map` section of the configuration file.
```yaml
exporters:
  otelexporter:
    metric_aggregation_map:
      # add the following line
      kindling_topology_request_average_duration_nanoseconds: histogram 
```
## Trace As Metric
We made some rules for considering whether a request is abnormal. For the abnormal request, the detail request information is considered as useful for debugging or profiling. We name this kind of data "trace". It is not a good practice to store such data in Prometheus as some labels are high-cardinality, so we picked up some labels from the original ones to generate a new kind of metric, which is called "Trace As Metric". The following table shows what labels this metric contains.

### Metrics List

### Notes
**Note 1**: The field `success` for `kindling_tcp_connect_duration_nanoseconds_total` is always `true`.

**Note 2**: The field `errno` is not `0` only if the TCP socket is blocking and there is an error happened. There are multiple possible values it could contain. See the `ERRORS` section of the [connect(2) manual](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/connect.2.html) for more details.

**Note 3**: The field `pid` and `comm` will not exist if you set `need_process_info` to `false` (default is false), that will reduce the pressure of Prometheus.

## PromQL Example
Here are some examples of how to use these metrics in Prometheus, which can help you understand them faster.
